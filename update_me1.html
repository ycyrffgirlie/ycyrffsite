<center><b>Update on me</b>
<br>
<br>
Okay, an update on me and my Cyrff collection. Since writing the me page, back in November, I have received the Cyrff vinyl that I was waiting for. It was the 12&quot; untitled vinyl with <i>Cymru, LLoegr a LLanrwst</i> on it. Also since writing this page Sherbet Antlers have released a single called <i>Hikikomorai/Let Yourself Go</i>, which I happen to have a copy of in my collection of CDs – don’t ask how many copies I have of it! La la la la la mmm la la la la ba ba la.
<br>
<br>
I had an e-mail from someone asking if I wanted any pictures of the band. I said I would like pictures of Cyrff and they e-mailed me the pictures. Has anyone else got any other pictures of the band? If they do, please, please e-mail them to me at <a href="mailto:y_cyrff_girlie@[nospam]yahoo.co.uk?subject=pictures/lluniau">y_cyrff_girlie@yahoo.co.uk</a>.
<br>
<br>
Anyway going back to February, I went and saw Sherbet Antlers at the Clwb Ifor Bach and they did <i>LLawenydd Heb DDiwedd</i>. Afterwards I sent them an e-mail asking them for the lyrics to <i>LLawenydd Heb DDiwedd</i>. They sent me the lyrics – oh boy they didn’t know that I own the Cyrff site and that I was going to put them up on the site until I e-mailed them asking for permission to use them on the site. Err I think I am in the doghouse!
<br>
<br>
In March, I bought <i>Damwain Mewn FFatri Cyllyll a FFyrc</i> from eBay, which had the added advantage of a picture of the band on the cover - another picture of the band!
<br>
<br>
Couple of months later, I managed to buy <i>Mae DDoe Yn DDoe</i> on tape, <i>LLawenydd Heb DDiwedd</i> on tape and <i>Damwain Mewn FFatri Cyllyll a FFyrc</i> from eBay. Now I can have one set with me and another lot at home.
<br>
<br>
I have got a digital camera so now I can take pictures of various Y Cyrff vinyl covers.
<br>
<br>
I have also managed to buy <i>Mae DDoe Yn DDoe</i> on CD from eBay which will allow me to get sound clips from it instead of having to download the songs from the Internet. A very nice fan copied a bootleg for me. I would like to thank that fan and so far I haven’t stopped playing it – another thing to drive my family and friends up the wall with! Mmm they love that - lots. ;-) Some day I will get my family to appreciate good music.
<br>
<br>
I went on holiday to Wales. I went armed with my Cyrff folder and some thing to do, relating to the site. I asked about Y Cyrff but no luck. I finished writing the first draft of this page and included this: &quot;I am currently in my hideout in Wales. I am drinking a bottle of beer so iechyd da o Gymru&quot;. 
<br>
<br>
I am back from my holidays and listening to Y Cyrff.  I got some videos (two people have sent me these videos) to add to the site but I need to get permission to use them. Well there’s a re-design of the site to work on. It has become a routine for me, on most nights, to watch the videos from 10.30 p.m to 11.30. This has led family members to poke their heads around the door and ask, &quot;You are not watching Cyrff again, are you?&quot; with a disappointed look while I am quickly trying to change the channel. I am sure that certain family members are starting to worry about my sanity.  Oh well!
<br>
<br>
I said I am currently taking from the running the site which I am. I have got lots of plans to meet up with friends that I haven’t seen for a long time (unless you count down the pub).  I know bad bad web mistress! I also got a room to tidy. I wonder what I will get for Christmas - a Cyrff record or two?
