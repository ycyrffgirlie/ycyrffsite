		<p>Welsh pop heroes Catatonia yesterday paid tribute to their guitar technician who tragically died in a road accident.</p>

		<p>Barry Cawley, 37, of Denbigh Street, LLanrwst, suffered fatal injuries last Sunday when his bicycle collided with a Fiat car driven by Gerrard Martin Jacovelli, who also died.</p>

		<p>Guitarist Mark Roberts told how the band is devastated by the loss of one of their close friends.</p>

		<p>And he said that without <span lang="cy">Y Cyrff</span>, a group which included Barry and two members of the future Catatonia, the current supergroup would not exist.</p>

		<p>The horrific accident happened as Barry and two friends cycled to Betws - y - Coed on the old B5106.</p>

		<p>Both victims were force off the road in the collision.</p>

		<p>Hundreds of family and friends are expected to attend his funeral at Capel Selon in LLanrwst on Monday at 2pm.</p>

		<p>He will be dressed in his denim jacket and Levi jeans - as he is remembered.</p>

		<p>Mr Roberts revealed that Catatonia's lead singer, Cerys Matthews, is deeply shocked at Barry's sudden death: Cerys is really distraught.</p>

		<p>&quot;Everyone has treated like a queen, but Barry would say to her &quot;Get your own water!&quot; which she appreciated. He was somebody who grounded her.&quot;</p>

		<p>Catatonia is made up of Mark Roberts and Paul Jones, of LLanrwst; Cerys Matthews, who was born in Cardiff and brought up in Swansea; Owen Powell, from Cardiff and Aled Richards from LLanelli.</p>

		<p>One early line-up of the group <span lang="cy">Y Cyrff</span> included Barry, Dylan Huges, and future Catatonia members Paul Jones and Mark Roberts.</p>

		<p>Mr Roberts recalled: &quot;I was in the same year as Barry's brother Ian at Ysgol Dyffryn Conwy.</p>

		<p>&quot;Barry taught me to play the guitar. My guitar used to get out of tune. When I was</p>

	<td>
		<p>13 I would go around to their house every Thursday.</p>

		<p>&quot;I was 13 and he was 18. It shows how patient he was.&quot;</p>

		<p>When they all formed <span lang="cy">Y Cyrff</span> in the late eighties lead guitarist Barry was the only one who could drive.</p>

		<p>&quot;We started playing gigs in London. We got in the NME and on The Tube and Old Grey Whistle Test,&quot; recalled Mr Roberts.</p>

		<p>&quot;We toured Europe - Germany, Poland and Czechoslovakia. The fans didn't understand English let alone Welsh, but they liked the music.</p>

		<p>&quot;We would do cover version of songs by The Clash then our songs. In the end we stopped trying to be punk because it had died ten years before!&quot;</p>

		<p><span lang="cy">Y Cyrff</span> broke up, but as Catatonia found worldwide stardom Barry travelled with them from Los Angeles to New York to Tokyo as a guitar technician.</p>

		<p>Last year, visited 16 countries with the band rubbing shoulders with other stars.</p>

		<p>&quot;His skill was improvising under pressure. If I broke a string on stage he would notice. It would be seamless,&quot; added Mr Roberts.</p>

		<p>&quot;Maybe he was not as ruthlessly ambitious as the rest of us.&quot;</p>

		<p>Yesterday Barry Cawley's partner 36-year-old Meryl Harrison, a nurse, bravely prepared to contribute to his funeral service.</p>

		<p>&quot;It's awful. We were going to have children. We were soulmates. Barry knew Tom Jones but he was not a show off. He would not brag about,&quot; she added.</p>

		<p>A recording of &quot;England, Wales and LLanrwst&quot; will be played at the funeral service and all Catatonia are expected to be there.</p>

		<p>Barry leaves his parents, who run <span lang="cy">Cigyddion y Parc</span> Butchers in LLanrwst and three brothers Alan, 39, Peter, 34, and 32-year-old Ian.</p>
